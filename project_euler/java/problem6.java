Sum square difference
Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares 
of the first ten natural numbers and the square of 
the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of 
the first ONE HUNDRED natural numbers and the square of the sum.

SOLUTION: 2.516415E7 = 25164150
